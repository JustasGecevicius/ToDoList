# To-Do List

## Description

This is the biggest project of my to date that uses primarily HTML/CSS/JavaScript and a few libraries. This is an app that allows the user to create projects and later add tasks to those projects. The tasks are sorted by date and can be highlighted. There is a possibility to check tasks for Today or a Week. All the information is saved in local Storage.

## Technologies used

### `HTML/CSS/Javascript`

The HTML and CSS and relatively basic. The majority of the website relies on JavaScript. There are a lot of different components and modules that are all tied together with webpack. Since there is no back-end all the information is saved in user's local storage. Everytime there is a change in the tasks the storage is updated. 

### `lodash and date-fns`

These libraries were used to sort the tasks by date, to allow selection of tasks based on date and display them in the correct order

## Final Remarks

This project forced me to learn how to interact with libraries, understand their documentation and implement their functionalities into my own projects. It also helped me to learn how to work with local storage and the JSON file type.
